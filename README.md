Interpreting and computing given formulas is handled by great library exprtk and primitive GUI relies on SFML.

Application allows to set region of 2D plane where computations will be done for big set of points. Additionaly it can export and import entered settings and plotted image.

As one of my first attempts to use SFML GUI is done somewhat poorly. Additionaly it is basic and underdeveloped, but changing it would require massive rewriting.
