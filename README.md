# Graph generator  
This project originated as an attempt to implement calculator using reverse polish notation. It worked, but turned out that proper handling of errors and functions like sinus or sqrt weren't so simple. Shortly after that I found exprtk library and started experimenting with it. Finally I decided to write program to plot inequalities (true black, false white) in Cartesian coordinate system. Here I firstly used simple GUI system later reused in few projects. Everything was written using SFML, GUI is basic and underdeveloped, but changing it would require massive rewriting. Application allows to tweak some values and export plot and settings. Additionaly, it supports passing arguments from the command line.
